# Outline of potential topics

Building signals
- harmonics : sines + noise in freq addition

Physics of EEG
- signal acquisition
- analog to digital conversion
    - quantitization 4-bit, 8-bit, 16-bit 
    - write a little code for this
- sources artifacts
- amplitude problems

sampling theorm 

### Aliasing and filters 

#### Filters
- "ideal filters"
- FIR filters
- IIR filters (match electronic analog filters)
- filter artifacts 
  - ringing and
  - edge effects 
  - signal lag 
    - example of what happens if you have signal lag and you filter just one signal 
- designing for different parts


#### Nyquest sampling theorm and Aliasing
 - show how sigal gets folded over across the N_{Nyquist}

### Noise

- ground loops ?

### Getting into Quantitative EEG
#### DSA 
#### Demonstration of importance of phase vs spectrum in EEG
#### Other QEEG measures?

30 mm/sec on pages 300mm weide (so 10s)

#### Montages and montage derivations
- linear operators
- laplacian

#### Quasi-static approximation
- volume conduction
