# Outline of potential topics

Physics of EEG
- signal acquisition
- analog to digital conversion
    - quantitization 4-bit, 8-bit, 16-bit 
    - write a little code for this
- sources artifacts
- amplitude problems

sampling theorm 

### Aliasing and filters 

#### Filters
- "ideal filters"
- filter artifacts 
  - ringing
  - edge effects
  - signal lag 

- designing for different parts

### Noise

- ground loops ?

### Getting into Quantitative EEG
#### DSA 
#### Demonstration of importance of phase vs spectrum in EEG
#### Other QEEG measures?
